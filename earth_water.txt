WATER ALL AROUND
Look around you.
Water is everywhere.
Water falls from the sky and flows overland.
It goes into the ground and fills bodies of water.

WATER AS A LIQUID
Most of our planet is covered with water.
Water is in oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Water falls from clouds as rain.
All this water is in a liquid state.
Liquid water can flow from one place to another.
It takes the shape of whatever it is in.
